LectureCapture Tube - Privacy Policy  
Last Updated: March 19, 2025  

This privacy policy explains how LectureCapture Tube ("we," "us," or "our"), a Chrome extension developed by sir-satyam, collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our extension. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices. By installing and using LectureCapture Tube, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

1. Information We Collect  
LectureCapture Tube collects the following types of information to provide its functionality:  

a. Usage Data  
- We collect anonymized data about how you interact with the extension, such as the number of screenshots taken, PDFs generated, and button clicks (e.g., "Generate PDF," "Clear All"). This data is sent to Google Analytics for usage analysis.  
- Events tracked include installation, updates, screenshot captures, PDF downloads, and user engagement actions (e.g., sharing or opening the sidebar). These events may include timestamps and a randomly generated client ID for analytics purposes.  
- Video metadata, such as titles, URLs, timestamps, durations, and dimensions (width and height), is collected when you capture screenshots or generate PDFs from YouTube videos.  

b. User-Generated Content  
- When you take screenshots of YouTube videos, the extension captures images of the video content at specific timestamps, along with associated metadata (e.g., video title, URL). This data is stored locally on your device unless you choose to generate a PDF or share it.  
- If you submit feedback through the extension, we collect your name (if provided), email address (optional), rating (1-5 stars), feedback text, browser type, language, and submission date.  

c. Technical Data  
- We collect a unique client ID generated randomly and stored locally to track usage across sessions via Google Analytics.  
- The extension may access your browser type (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and language settings for feedback submission and analytics purposes.  

d. Data Not Collected  
- LectureCapture Tube does not collect your personal identity information (e.g., full name, address) unless you voluntarily provide it in feedback.  
- We do not access or store your browsing history, cookies, or any data unrelated to YouTube video screenshot functionality.  

2. How We Collect Information  
- Usage data is collected automatically when you interact with the extension’s features (e.g., capturing screenshots, generating PDFs).  
- Screenshots and video metadata are captured when you press the "P" key, click the screenshot button, or use related features on YouTube pages.  
- Feedback data is collected when you submit it through the extension’s feedback form.  
- Technical data, like the client ID, is generated and stored locally on your device upon installation or first use.  

3. How We Use the Information  
We use the collected information for the following purposes:  
- To provide core functionality, such as capturing screenshots, generating PDFs, and displaying them in the sidebar with timestamps and metadata.  
- To improve the extension by analyzing anonymized usage data (e.g., how often features are used) via Google Analytics.  
- To process and store feedback you submit, helping us address issues and enhance user experience.  
- To enable sharing features, such as sending screenshots or PDFs via the Web Share API, if supported by your browser.  
- All screenshot images and PDFs are processed and stored locally on your device unless you choose to download or share them.  

4. How We Share Information  
- Google Analytics: Anonymized usage data (e.g., events like "screenshot captured" with timestamps and client ID) is sent to Google Analytics servers for analysis. This data does not include personally identifiable information. See Google’s Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details on how they handle data.  
- Google Sheets: If you submit feedback, your feedback data (name, email if provided, rating, feedback text, browser, language, date) is sent to a Google Sheets Web App for storage and review by the developer. This is done via a secure HTTPS connection. See Google’s Privacy Policy for more information.  
- ExtensionPay: If you choose to manage a subscription, your payment-related interactions are handled by ExtensionPay (https://extensionpay.com). We do not collect or store payment details directly. Refer to ExtensionPay’s privacy policy for details.  
- Third-Party Links: The extension includes links to external sites (e.g., Amazon affiliate links, Chrome Web Store). Clicking these links may result in data collection by those sites, subject to their privacy policies.  
- We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except as described above or required by law.  

5. Storage and Security  
- Screenshots, video metadata, and PDFs are stored locally on your device using Chrome’s storage API (chrome.storage.local). This data persists until you clear it via the "Clear All" feature or uninstall the extension.  
- Feedback data is stored in a Google Sheets document accessible only to the developer for review.  
- The client ID for Google Analytics is stored locally on your device and linked to anonymized usage data.  
- We use reasonable measures, such as secure HTTPS connections for data transmission, to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.  

6. User Rights and Choices  
- You can clear all stored screenshots and metadata by clicking "Clear All" in the extension’s sidebar.  
- Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data (screenshots, metadata, client ID) from your device.  
- You may opt out of providing feedback or including an email address, as these are optional.  
- To opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you can use browser tools like the Google Analytics Opt-Out Add-on (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).  
- If you are in the European Union or California, you may have additional rights under GDPR or CCPA, such as requesting data deletion. Contact us via linkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyam-kumar-4399a3217/ to exercise these rights.
